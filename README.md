# Game_AI_Universitaet_Wien


The aim of the project is to offer central concepts of software development like:
• Requirements analysis,
• Verification, validation of software,
• Software projects,
• Software development processes,
• Security in software development,
• Maintenance, further development, rollout
• Etc.


These goals are achieved by developing a software project in the form of a interactive game. The developer is provided with documentation in the form of 
a game idea and the network protocol which is to be used for communication between server and client.

The implementation of the project is carried out in three subtasks / deadlines:

Sub-task 1 - Analysis & Design: The aim of this sub-task is to define functional and non-functional requirements 
from the game idea (documentation) provided. As well as recognizing and documenting relevant use cases. In addition, 
the first drafts of our future implementations (client and server) and use cases must be modeled as class diagrams and sequence diagrams.


Sub-task 2 - Implementation of the client (TODO) <<-----------

Game description:

The basic idea of the game is that two AIs on the same map have to perform a similar task. The AI that fulfills this faster wins the game which
is turn-based (therefore each AI takes turns taking a game action). The map on which the game is played is not fixed, but is created by both AIs
independently and automatically at the start of the game (one half of the map each).
